The United Mars Regime (UMR) is carving a kingdom out of the red wasteland, and we’re not asking permission. Mines ripping wealth from the crust, bio-domes sprouting life, fusion grids burning bright—Mars is ours to bend. We’ve got the plan: a clean, green planet that screams humanity’s got its shit together. You’re the missing piece.

This is no vacation spot. Dust’ll choke you, quotas’ll grind you down—but that’s the rush. We need heavy hitters with cash and guts to fuel the AI revolution. Bots that shred rock, grow food, build cities—all yours to command. Mining? Ag? Infrastructure? The UMR’s ministries are open for business. Drop your credits, claim your slice, and etch your name in the dirt.

We’re not here to play nice. Progress is the mission—measured in ore hauled and domes raised. Bring your squad, bring your stacks, and step up. The frontier’s live—claim it.
